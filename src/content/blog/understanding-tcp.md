TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite and ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. It breaks data into packets, numbers them, and ensures they arrive in order. If packets are lost or corrupted, TCP will retransmit them.

Common applications that use TCP include web browsers (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP).
