Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines. They start faster, use fewer resources, and provide better isolation than running applications directly on the host system.

Key Docker concepts include images (blueprints for containers), containers (running instances), and registries (storage for images like Docker Hub).

Common Docker commands include `docker build` to create images, `docker run` to start containers, and `docker ps` to list running containers.
