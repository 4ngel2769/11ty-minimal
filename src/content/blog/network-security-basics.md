Network security involves protecting computer networks and their data from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks. It encompasses both hardware and software technologies that work together to create a secure network infrastructure.

Common network threats include malware, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. Understanding these threats is crucial for implementing effective defenses.

Essential security measures include firewalls to filter traffic, encryption to protect data in transit, access controls to limit user permissions, and regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities.

Network monitoring tools help detect suspicious activities in real-time, allowing for quick response to potential security incidents.
