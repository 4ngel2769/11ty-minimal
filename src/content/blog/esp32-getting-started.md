The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it perfect for IoT projects. It features dual-core processing, low power consumption, and a rich set of peripherals.

Setting up ESP32 development involves installing the ESP-IDF framework or using Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support. The ESP-IDF provides more advanced features and better performance optimization.

Key features include GPIO pins for interfacing with sensors and actuators, ADC for reading analog values, PWM for motor control, and built-in cryptographic hardware for secure communications.

Popular ESP32 applications include home automation systems, sensor networks, wireless communication devices, and embedded web servers.
